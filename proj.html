		<h4 id="title"> International Project 2015-2016 -- Solar Aid </h4>
		<p>The International Project is a year-long district-wide fundraising project focused on tackling major global cause areas. This year, Interact District Council is partnering up with Solar-Aid in order to encourage clean energy and sustainable development.</p>
		<h4> The Problem </h4>
		<p>598 million people in Africa alone have no access to electricity. Without electricity families have no clean source of light, leaving millions to rely on expensive and dangerous alternatives. Many use homemade kerosene lamps which are a poor source of light; they emit toxic black smoke, eat up to 15% of a family&apos;s income and are are extremely hazardous. Children can&apos;t study at night, the working day ends prematurely and indoor air pollution presents a serious health hazard.</p>
		<h4>The Solution</h4>

		</video>
		<p>By donating solar-powered lights, we will break the cycle of poverty by allowing children to better pursue their education and by enabling families to have financial independence. For every solar light shining, there is one less kerosene lamp, saving around 200 kg of carbon dioxide per year.<br/>As a district, we will donate 1 solar light for every $4.50 donated. Our goal is to raise $15,075, enough for 3350 solar lights.</p>

		<h4 id="title"> Community Project 2015-2016 -- The WAPI Project </h4>
		<h4> The Problem </h4>
		<p>Over 1 billion people in the world do not have access to safe and clean drinking water. Furthermore, 2 million people die every year from water-related diseases, such as malaria, cholera, and rotaviruses, caused from microorganisms in the water. The lack of access to clean and safe drinking water to 3rd world countries is a serious issue that can be and should be addressed and resolved. </p>
		<h4>The Solution</h4>
		<p>Sponsored by their Rotary Clubs, the Area 2 Interact Clubs of Alhambra High School, San Gabriel High School, and Mark Keppel High School, are working together to build WAPIs (Water Pasteurization Indicators) that will then be delivered to the countries in need of clean drinking water.</p>
